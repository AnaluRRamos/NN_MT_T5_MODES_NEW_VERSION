Direct Steps to Fix NVIDIA Driver Installation on Your Current VM
Step 1: Remove All Existing NVIDIA Installations
To ensure we're starting with a clean slate, remove all current NVIDIA drivers and DKMS installations:

sh
Copiar código
sudo apt-get purge '*nvidia*'
sudo apt-get autoremove
sudo apt-get clean
Step 2: Install Development Tools and Dependencies
Install the necessary build tools and kernel headers:

sh
Copiar código
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential dkms linux-headers-$(uname -r) libc6-dev
Ensure you are using the correct headers for the running kernel.

Step 3: Download and Install the NVIDIA Driver Manually
Manually installing the driver using the .run file can sometimes work better than the apt method in situations where compatibility issues arise.

Download the NVIDIA Driver: You need to download the driver directly from NVIDIA. For your GPU (NVIDIA T4), you can use the version 525 or one specifically recommended for your GPU:

sh
Copiar código
wget https://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/525.147.05/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-525.147.05.run
chmod +x NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-525.147.05.run
Switch to Console Mode: Since you are installing a new driver, it's safer to disable X server (which may conflict during installation):

sh
Copiar código
sudo systemctl isolate multi-user.target
Run the Installer: Run the .run file to install the driver:

sh
Copiar código
sudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-525.147.05.run
During installation:
Agree to license terms.
Say yes to precompiled kernel modules if prompted.
Say no to installing the OpenGL libraries (to avoid potential conflicts).
Step 4: Check Installation
After the installation completes:

Load the NVIDIA Kernel Module: To ensure that the module is loaded:

sh
Copiar código
sudo modprobe nvidia
Verify with nvidia-smi: Check if the driver is installed correctly and can communicate with the GPU:

sh
Copiar código
nvidia-smi
If everything worked correctly, nvidia-smi should now display information about your GPU.

Step 5: Restart the System
If the driver has been installed successfully:

sh
Copiar código
sudo reboot
After the reboot, check again with nvidia-smi to ensure everything is functioning.

Additional Troubleshooting Steps
If the above steps fail or if you get specific errors during the installation:

Check Kernel Compatibility: The kernel you're running (6.1.0-28-cloud-amd64) might be problematic for the NVIDIA drivers. Consider downgrading to a more stable, LTS kernel version:

sh
Copiar código
sudo apt-get install linux-image-5.10.0-23-amd64 linux-headers-5.10.0-23-amd64
Reboot into this kernel and repeat the NVIDIA driver installation steps.

Look at DKMS Logs: If DKMS fails, check the log for more details:

sh
Copiar código
cat /var/lib/dkms/nvidia/525.147.05/build/make.log
The errors here can give specific insights into what is failing during the kernel module build process.
